In this project the student endeavors to build machine learning models that will aid in making accurate diabetes predictions. The student will build models to answer the following research using the apriori algorithm , decision trees, and logistic regression: 
What is the correlation between the presence of heart disease and the development of diabetes? 
Is there a threshold at which the BMI level increases risk of diabetes? 
How do blood glucose levels correlate with variables like age, BMI, and hypertension?
