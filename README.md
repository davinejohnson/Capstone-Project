In this project the student endeavors to build machine learning models that will aid in making accurate diabetes predictions. The student will build models to answer the following research using the random forest, decision trees, and logistic regression: 
1. What features are most important in predicting diabetes?
2. Which model is best at predicting diabetes?
3. How do blood glucose levels correlate with variables like age, BMI, and hypertension?
